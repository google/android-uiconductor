                <td>This field specifies the snippet package in the APK that has been installed onto the connected device.
                    Once selected, Nuwa will fetch all the methods under that package and list them in the Method Name box.
                    Note: If the package cannot be found, the method list will be empty.

                <td>Arguments</td>
                <td>You should enter the corresponding arguments that the selected snippet call requires here.
                    The arguments should be separated by ',' and every one of them is kept in the correct format of the variable type.
                    For example, the input of method <b>wifiConnectSimple(String, String)</b> can be <b>GoogleGuest, null</b>.

                <td>Snippet Service Only (No validation)</td>
                <td>This field is to set whether you want to validate the return value or not. If the snippet you select returns null, this box will be automatically selected.
                    Note that if you uncheck this box for snippets that do not return a value, it will cause the action to fail.
